    <h1>Welcome to Riot Watch</h1>
    <p><center>In Southern Africa, strikes can erupt with little warning and can quickly descend into chaos 
        and destruction of shops, buildings and infrastructure. As people take to the streets in protest, the motives behind their grievances can 
        often remain unclear, as the situation rapidly spirals out of control. Property can be destroyed and 
        tires can be burned as the strikes become increasingly violent, and innocent bystanders can find themselves 
        in life-threatening danger. With the sheer mass of people involved, police and security forces may be unable 
        to contain the situation as violence can escalate even faster sometimes, making it even more hazardous. 
        It is important to remember the potential consequences of such demonstrations, and the need for caution when 
        dealing with the situation..</center></p><br>
